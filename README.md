# Overview
This project focuses on analyzing factors influencing obesity levels through interactive Power BI dashboards. The visualizations explore behavioral, genetic, and lifestyle aspects such as diet, physical activity, family history, and transportation modes. It aims to derive insights into how these variables impact Body Mass Index (BMI), weight, and obesity classifications.

ðŸ”§ Tools & Technologies Used
Power BI â€“ For building and publishing dashboards

Python (Pandas, NumPy) â€“ Data preprocessing

MS Excel â€“ For data structuring and validation

Kaggle Dataset â€“ Source of obesity-related data

# Dashboard Highlights
# Page 1: General Obesity Trends

BMI, Age, Weight Overview: KPI cards showing the average BMI (29.70), average weight (86.59), and average age (24.32) across all records.

Alcohol & Smoking Influence: Treemap analyzing weight based on smoking and alcohol consumption patterns.

Veggies Consumption vs Obesity: Donut chart highlighting how vegetable consumption correlates with obesity categories.

Obesity Gender Split: Line chart showing how obesity types are distributed by gender.

# Page 2: Behavioral & Genetic Influence
Physical Activity, Tech Use & Alcohol: Dual line chart exploring the relationship between alcohol habits and averages of tech usage and physical activity.

Family History: Bar chart displaying the impact of genetic predisposition (overweight family history) on obesity levels.

Meals vs Weight: Bar chart showing weight distribution by number of meals per day.

Snacking Habits: Donut chart showing snacking frequency and its correlation with obesity.
